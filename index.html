    				Hello, my name is Jason Tham and if you've made it here you are looking at my portfolio of web creations.  I learned full stack web development starting in November 2015 by attending General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program.  You can check out my profile on their <a href="https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/profiles/jason-tham" target="_blank">website here</a>.
    			</p>
          <p>
            During this program I learned many things about coding and myself, especially the joy of the completion of the entire design process.  Turning your ideas into a fully functional application is one of the most satisfying feelings I've had in my professional career.  My training has been heavy in object oriented programming fundamentals with an emphasis in learning how to build web apps using the MVC framework.  I've coded primarily in Javascript and Ruby with exposure to some front-end frameworks like Backbone, Angular, and React.  Further below you can see a summary of the projects I've worked on as well as links to these applications hosted on various places on the internet.  If you're interested in seeing my Github profile with links to all my repositories or my Linked-in profile with more information about my professional history, please check out the links below.
